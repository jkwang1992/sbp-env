Sampling-based Motion Planners' Testing Environment
===================================================

Here is where ``sbp-env``'s documentation, the Sampling-based Motion Planner
Benchmark suite, lies.
To quickly get started, see the :ref:`quick_start` guide.
For various documentation of th implemented planners and samplers, checkout the
corresponding sections from the side bar.

The code is hosted in a `repository <https://github.com/soraxas/sbp-env>`_, and the
implementation requires *Python 3.7+*. The code comes with some example environments,
and in addition, several state-of-the-art sampling-based :ref:`motion_planners_page`
and :ref:`samplers_page` are implemented.
