Commandline Interface
=====================

The commandline interface can be accessed from the ``main.py`` file.
You can invoke the **cli** via

.. code-block:: console

    $ python main.py <PLANNER> <MAP> [--options]

All functionality of selecting planners and customising parameters are accessible from within the commandline interface.
If you just want to quickly test different planners in a newly created environment, then commandline would be the easiest option to get started.
